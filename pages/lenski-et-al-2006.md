This is a summary of [Lenski, Barrick and Ofria [-@Lenski2006] ](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040428). The following are direct quotes of the original article. My comments are given as footnotes, highlighting and italics.

- Organisms must have a **balance between robustness and evolvability**, that is, between resisting and allowing change in their own internal states.
- A genome may be robust because it encodes *proofreading and repair systems*[^1] that reduce replication errors or because it is organized such that many *mutations have little effect*[^2] on its phenotype.
- We will focus on genomic robustness to mutations.
- Two mechanisms that could make a genome more robust are *genetic redundancy*, so that many otherwise deleterious mutations are masked, and *proofreading during replication*, so that fewer mutations occur.
- Evolution at **low mutation rates** favors populations that achieve high fitness peaks, even if they are surrounded by steep cliffs, because mutations that push progeny off those cliffs are rare. 
- At **high mutation rates**, most offspring carry mutations, and selection favors populations that find lower fitness peaks surrounded by less precipitous mutational chasms.
- Environmental change is a pervasive feature of nature, and those physiological mechanisms that
allow organisms to **adjust to changing environments**, such as by regulating gene expression, will also compensate for the effects of many mutations.
- **Proofreading and repair must inhibit evolvability** because they reduce the production of new beneficial mutations. 
- Are robustness and evolvability inversely correlated more generally? Robustness and evolvability might again be positively, rather than negatively, correlated.
- Redundancy can also promote adaptation by **allowing duplicated genes to evolve distinct functions**[^3]
- Evolving populations can also become robust by finding regions of genotypic space that are flat because they contain a high proportion of neutral mutations.
- Deleterious mutations may lead to genetic neighborhoods that are more promising.
- One could ask how robustness and evolvability change depending on whether evolution occurs in **constant or variable environments** [@Meyers2005].
